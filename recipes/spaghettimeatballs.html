    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For the most flavorful meatballs, I recommend using equal parts beef, veal, and pork; at most supermarkets, this blend is labeled “meatloaf mix.” If your market doesn't carry the blend, you can use half beef and half pork (since ground veal isn't readily available).</p>
    <p>For the cheese, be sure to use the real-deal imported Parmigiano-Reggiano from Italy; domestic Parmesan pales in comparison. You can always tell if it's authentic by looking at the rind, which is embossed with the name over and over. If the cheese is already grated, it should be labeled “Parmigiano-Reggiano,” not “Parmesan.”</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh basil (plus more for serving)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>etc...</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F and set an oven rack in the middle position.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the egg, basil, parsley, oregano, salt, pepper, garlic and water. Add the meat, breadcrumbs and cheese and mix until just combined (your hands are the best tool). Do not overwork it.</li>
        <li>etc...</li>
