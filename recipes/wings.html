    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>One of the most popular bar snacks in the U.S. was actually born in a small Buffalo, NY, bar in 1964. Without the Anchor Bar and the ingenuity of its owner (she wanted to re-purpose leftover cooked wings to feed her family), many a game day, bar-hopping American would likely never know you could combine crispy wings bathed in sweet-hot sauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lb. chicken wings</li>
        <li>2 tbsp. Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp. garlic powder</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>etc...</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400Â° and place a wire rack over a baking sheet. In a large bowl, toss chicken wings with oil and season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Transfer to prepared baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake until chicken is golden and skin is crispy, 50 to 60 minutes, flipping the wings halfway through.</li>
        <li>etc...</li>
    </ol>
